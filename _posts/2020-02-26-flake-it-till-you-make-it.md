Iroh: Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
Toph: You seem a little too old.
Iroh: (laughs) Perhaps I am.
Toph: I know what you're thinking ... I look like I can't handle being by myself.
Iroh: I wasn't thinking that.
Toph: You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea!
Iroh: I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.
Toph: People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself.
Iroh: You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your owno, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you.
Toph: (laughs) So where is your nephew?
Iroh: I've been tracking him actually.
Toph: Is he lost?
Iroh: Yes, a little bit. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away.
Toph: So now you're following him.
Iroh: I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.
Toph: Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it. Thank you.
Iroh: My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
Toph: No, thank you for what you said. it helped me.
Iroh: I'm glad.

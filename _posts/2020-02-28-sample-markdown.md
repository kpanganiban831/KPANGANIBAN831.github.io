The Jasmine Dragon is a tea shop owned by yours truly that I opened with my newphew Zuko. After escaping the fire nation, we found refuge in Ba Sing Se and became the best tea shop in the city!

## Shop Becames Ours

After liberating Ba Sing Se because of my super beast firebending skills, I was able to fully open the shop and become the best tea shop ever. In front of my tea shop, Aang and Katara kissed, and we also have some peng uniforms.

My name is Uncle Iroh and I really like these things:

- My nephew named Zuko
- Tea
- Talking with strangers
- Defeating my enemies with relative ease
- Dragons

Such great things to like

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just read all about [me](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Iroh) and it will answer **all** your questions.
